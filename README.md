# GPT File Reader
This script is designed to read text from a document and answer user queries using OpenAI's ChatGPT. Here's a guide on how to use this script:

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed.
Install required packages using pip install openai python-dotenv.

## Setup

Sign up for an OpenAI account if you don't have one and obtain your API key.
Create a .env file in the same directory as the script and add the following line: open_ai_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY.
Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key.

## How to Use
- Make sure the file you want to read (e.g., jokes.txt) is in the same directory as the script.
- Open the script and modify the filepath variable to match the name of your file (e.g., filepath = "jokes.txt").
- Replace the query variable with the question or prompt you want to use with the file (e.g., query = "Summarize this document").
- Run the script in your terminal or IDE with python main.py.
- The script will read the document, process your query, and print the response generated by ChatGPT.

## Example Usage
```
filepath = "jokes.txt"
document = read_document(filepath)

query = "Summarize this document"
answer = answer_query(document, query)
print(answer)
```
Replace `jokes.txt` with the name of the file you want to read and change the query variable to the question you want to ask about the document. Run the script, and it will print the answer to your query.
